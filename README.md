- Use `require` for importing images to ensure compatibility with Expo.
- Prefer using **`useWindowDimensions`** for responsive layouts instead of static `Dimensions`.
- Some projects may use Expo modules such as:
  - `LinearGradient`
  - `expo-font`
  - `react-native-reanimated`
  - Other Expo utilities
