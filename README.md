# React Native Projects

This repository contains a few small React Native apps I built while learning and practicing.  
Each project is inside its own folder and can be opened and run individually.

## How to run any project

- Open the project folder  
- Install dependencies  
- Start the Expo development server

Example:

cd NumberGuesser

npm install

npx expo start

You can run the app on a device using Expo Go or on an emulator.

## Notes

- All projects use Expo and TypeScript.
- The structure and setup may vary slightly between projects as they were made for practice.
